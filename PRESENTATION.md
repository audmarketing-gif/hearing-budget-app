## Slide 2: The Challenge
**Title:** Current Financial Bottlenecks
**Bulleted List:**
*   **Visibility:** Difficulty tracking real-time spend against quarterly grants.
*   **Fragmentation:** Data scattered across invoices, POs, and spreadsheets.
*   **Reactive vs. Proactive:** hard to predict overspending before it happens.
*   **Communication:** Missed notifications for incoming grant allocations.

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before this tool, managing the marketing budget involved manual spreadsheet entry and chasing down PO numbers. We lacked a real-time view of our 'Burn Rate' and often missed when specific channel allocations were arriving."

## Slide 4: Feature Deep Dive - Allocations & Alerts
**Title:** Never Miss an Incoming Grant
**Visual:** Screenshot of the "Transactions" page and an image of the Email Alert.
**Key Points:**
*   **Scheduler:** Schedule future allocations (e.g., "Q4 Marketing Fund").
*   **Notification Engine:** System checks dates automatically.
*   **Email Integration:** Sends branded HTML emails to the finance team 3 days before funds arrive.
*   **Tech:** Powered by EmailJS for reliable delivery.

**Speaker Notes:**
"One of our biggest wins is the Allocation Alert system. If we have a grant coming in from a partner on the 15th, the system emails us automatically 3 days prior, ensuring we are ready to deploy those funds immediately."

## Slide 5: Feature Deep Dive - Financial AI
**Title:** AI-Driven Financial Analyst
**Visual:** Screenshot of the "Insights" page showing Gemini's analysis.
**Key Points:**
*   **Context Aware:** Analyzes current burn rate and specific category caps.
*   **Actionable Advice:** Suggests where to cut spend or where to reinvest.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Uses Google's latest model for high-speed, accurate reasoning.

**Speaker Notes:**
"We didn't just build a calculator; we built an advisor. Using the Insights tab, we send our financial data to Google's Gemini AI. It analyzes our burn rate and tells us, for example, if we are overspending on 'Events' relative to our 'Digital' ROI."
